# **Routing**

Next.js has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.

When a file is added to the pages directory, it's automatically available as a route.

The files inside the pages directory can be used to define most common patterns.

### **Index Routes**

The router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the directory.

- `pages/blog/first-post.js` → `/blog/first-post`
- `pages/dashboard/settings/username.js` → `/dashboard/settings/username`

### **Dynamic route segments**

To match a dynamic segment, you can use the bracket syntax. This allows you to match named parameters.

- `pages/blog/[slug].js` → `/blog/:slug (/blog/hello-world)`
- `pages/[username]/settings.js` → `/:username/settings (/foo/settings)`
- `pages/post/[...all].js` → `/post/*` `(/post/2020/id/title)`

## **Linking between pages**

The Next.js router allows you to do client-side route transitions between pages, similar to a single-page application.

A React component called `Link` is provided to do this client-side route transition.

```
import Link from 'next/link'

function Home() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link href="/">
          <a>Home</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/about">
          <a>About Us</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/blog/hello-world">
          <a>Blog Post</a>
        </Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  )
}

export default Home

```

The example above uses multiple links. Each one maps a path (`href`) to a known page:

- `/` → `pages/index.js`
- `/about` → `pages/about.js`
- `/blog/hello-world` → `pages/blog/[slug].js`

Any `<Link />` in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be prefetched by default (including the corresponding data) for pages using [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props). The corresponding data for [server-rendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) routes is not prefetched.
